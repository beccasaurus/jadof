As a coder, I like my blog/cms sites to be simple and database-free.

Like some other coders, I prefer to edit my blog posts in my preferred 
text editor.  Typically, I put abunchof [markdown][] files in a directory 
and put a web interface infront of it.

So ... I'm taking the tiny class that I typically use to wrap my blog 
posts and releasing it as a micro library incase anyone else finds it useful.
